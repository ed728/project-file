# project-file

Ed have a look at the "combat" code, that is a simplified version of the base engine I need.
Then the "Orignal" code is the final base engine.
I've also included the last "main" code which I can use for reference of what I aim to make.

the problems I am encountering is that the map generator is vague and hard to identify where things (like doors) will be placed.
I'd like an engine made up of seperated modules as this will make the growth of the project go smoothly.
